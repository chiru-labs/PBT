/**
 * @dev Contract for PBTs (Physical-Bound Tokens).
 * NFTs that are backed by a physical asset, through a chip embedded in the physical asset.
 * Note: this assumes that the chip remains attached to the physical object. Enforcing that is out of scope here.
 *
 * Extension to 721, in which the 721 implementation must not support public transfer methods that are not authenticated by a chip signature.
 * This is because such transfers would break any guarantees that an NFT is backed by the physical chip.
 *
 * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is <todo>.
 * TODO: print interface id here.
 *
 *
 *
 * (This part borrowed from https://github.com/Verilink/ERC721Physical) Requirements for such chip:
 * Capable of cryptographically secure generation of asymmetric key pairs
 * Capable of securely storing the private key of the asymmetric key pair with no interface
 * Capable of signing messages from the private key of the asymmetric key pair
 * Capable of retrieving the public key of the asymmetric key pair
 * There are no restrictions on the asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, communication methods, or power requirements.
 * The recommended chip is a passive device supporting NFC and secp256k1 ECC.
